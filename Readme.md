## Installation

  - Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-authentication-system.git

- Configure the database connection in the `.env` file. You can copy the provided `.env` file and update the values with your database configuration:

``` PORT

    DB_NAME 

    DB_PASSWORD 

    DB_USER

    DB_DIALECT 

    DB_HOST 

    DB_PORT 

    JWT_SECRET 

    JWT_EXP 
```
-  ***Make sure to replace your-database-... with the actual values.***

## Usage

- Start the application:

  ```npm start```


  ``` The server will start running at http://localhost:3000 ```


## API Routes

- POST /user: Register a new user. Required fields: username, email, password.
- POST /login: Authenticate user and get a JWT. Required fields: email, password.
- GET /user: Get user profile information. Requires authentication.
- PUT /profile: Update user profile information. Requires authentication. Fields: username, email, password.
- DELETE profile: Delete user account. Requires authentication.
- GET /login: User logout


## Error Handling

- Proper error handling is implemented for all routes to ensure appropriate error messages are returned to the client when necessary. Errors related to validation, authentication, and other common scenarios are handled and responded with meaningful messages.

## Middleware

- The project utilizes middleware for common tasks, such as logging, authentication, and error handling. The middleware is consistently used throughout the application to ensure proper functionality and maintain code organization.
